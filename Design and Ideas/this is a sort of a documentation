Synopsys: It should go in the following manner: Go from Marco to micro: Create a wish list of things that I want the application to do. THen,
organize the list.  Then create a pseudocode out of the list. Also, that organized list will provide me with the methods, classes, and packages I
will need

Wish List:
    Create a grid
    Create a play again button
    Every time the 'play again' button is clicked(it only becomes clickable after the the game is done), The grid(the button) is cleared.
    There are conditions For winning and losing. User Wins if they can get the there 3 Xs in a straight line; straight and diagonal.
    Computer wins if the 3 Os get in a straight line
    Its a draw if there is no chance of either getting a straight line anymore
    lets also put a reset button in case the user wants to restart the game

 Organized List:
    Create a grid
    Add a game reset button
    Computer wins if the 3 Os get in a straight line
    User wins if the 3 Xs get in a straight line
    Its a draw if there is no change of either getting a straight line anymore
    Every time the 'play again' button is clicked(it only becomes clickable after the the game is done), The grid(the button) is cleared.
    Game is playable until user wins, computer wins, or its a draw

PseudoCode:
CreateGrid(){ CreateTitle(); CreateResetBtn(); }

while(true){
    //Game Playing
    calculate remaining number of clickable buttons
    If numRemainingUnClickedBtns<=1: { its a draw; whoWon=neither;  }
    else{
        User Chooses an unclicked button
        If( Is there a complete row of 3 Xs? == True): Yes, then whoWon=user;
        else{
            Computer choooses an unclicked button
            if (Is there a complete row of 3 Os? == true): Yes, then whoWon=computer;
        }
    }

    //End notification
    if(whoWon()=="user"){
        Write above the 'Play again' button: "You Won!"
        CreatePayAgainButton()
    }
    if(whoWon()=="computer"){
        Write above the 'Play again' button: "Sorry, You Lose!"
        CreatePayAgainButton()
    }
    if(whoWon()=="neither"){
        Write above the 'Play again' button: "Its a Draw!"
        CreatePayAgainButton()
    }
}
